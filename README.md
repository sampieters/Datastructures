# Data Structures
## Introduction
This project was made as part of the course gegevensabstractie en -structuren. It includes several data structures
that where discussed in the course:

1. ADT Queue
2. ADT Stack
3. Binary Search Tree
4. Doubly Circular Linked List (Chain) 
5. Heap
6. 2-3 Tree
7. 2-3-4 Tree (contains bug)

## How to run?
To run this project, add the line "type=" followed by the datastructure you want to run to the "input.txt" file. This
can be done multiple times in the file.

1. "type=queue" for ADT Queue
2. "type=stack" for ADT Stack
3. "type=bst" for Binary Search Tree
4. "type=chain" for Doubly Circular Linked List (Chain) 
5. "type=heap" for Heap
6. "type=23" for 2-3 Tree
7. "type=234" for 2-3-4 Tree (contains bug)

After this line, all the operations on this datastructure can be performed by adding:
1. "insert {value}" for inserting a value
2. "delete {value}" for deleting a value (the value is not always needed, example: stack)
3. "print" to print the current state of the datastructure


## Details
### ADT Queue
The abstract datatype queue or ADT queue  is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 
principle. It represents a collection of elements where elements are added to the back (rear) and removed from the 
front (front). The elements that can be added to the ADT queue are all possible types (integer, float, double, string, 
...).

### ADT Stack
### Binary Search Tree
### Doubly Circular Linked List
### Heap
### 2-3 Tree
### 2-3-4 Tree
